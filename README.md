# Embedded
Improving the usage of the digital sensors through embedding hardware, software with specific requirements .

Using this project one can encrypt any value for output using any equation.

There is basically two steps.
  1. Setting up the device .
  2. Configure and apply logic for equation using application interface.
  
 It generates the simplified function based on the input and output values of a function using Karnaugh Maps method.
